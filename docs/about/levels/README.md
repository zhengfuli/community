## Addressing Persistent Poverty

Approximately 13% of census tracts in the United States are facing persistent poverty - defined by 20 percent of the population living in poverty for the last 30 years.  (Crandall 2015, Neighborhood Scale)  

The rate of poverty has stedily declined:  

1960 - 2,083 counties  
1990 - 765 counties  
2011 - 488 counties  


“In 1960, a total of 2,083 rural counties had 20% or more of their population
living below the poverty level. By 1990, the number had shrunk to 765, a
decline of nearly two-thirds and an indication of the remarkable reduction of
poverty across rural America.”
